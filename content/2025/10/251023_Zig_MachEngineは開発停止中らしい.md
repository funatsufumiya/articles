> Hey everyone, bad news: Mach is officially undead. I've gotten non-stop questions from people, DMs from people, and elsewhere asking me 'Is Mach dead?', 'there haven't been commits in a few months, is the project dead?' - and the official answer is now yes, Mach is officially undead. The grimbles got Wrench and it's gg. What does that mean in practice? Well..
> 
> - Website will continue running,
> - Applications written in Mach will continue to work,
> - Nominated Zig versions will continue to be nominated,
> - We'll still accept PRs when they are high-quality, complete, etc.,
> - Contributions in any form are still welcome.,
> - I'll still continue to develop Mach, and games in it, in my free time - and may write about it or improve docs as I see fit.,
> - I'll still hang around the Discord and continue to answer questions from people using it, etc.,
> - But, since it is undead, there is no promise of it ever being a living project again.,
> 
> Make sense? If anyone asks 'Is the project dead?', the official answer is now 'Yes, Mach is undead. &lt;link to this message>' Please help me in spreading the word by answering that question when it comes up: I don't want there to be any confusion about Mach being alive: it is very, very undead and will remain that way for a long time. Peace.
